# Blog

This blog website project was first made as a demo project of a Udemy course. I took in order to improve my practical knowledges about spring boot. The technology stack used in this project is Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Spring Data JPA, MySQL. I have developed and expand the original project especially in the part of admin system. To make the App stateless, I employed the JWT Authorization to replace Session. The trouble of that process comes from that we need to send every request with token. Fortunately, it can be solved by using Ajax to add the Authorization header for every request in admin system.  To achieve this, i have rewritten the whole admin system using JQuery Ajax. The admin system is therefore similar to a single page application and thanks to the JWT the project now is stateless.
